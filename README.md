## Overview

Data from City-Bike, a bike sharing transportation company similar to Bird or Lime scooters, was analyzed to highlight what makes the platform practical in NYC. The practicality of these aspects were then tested against the idea of operating a similar bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

To observe what made the platform practical we asked the following questions:

What specific features (weather, topography) of NYC allow for the city-bike to be appealing to customers?

What types of customers are consuming the city-bike platform? (Subscribers vs. One-time purchasers)

Are there specific areas in NYC that are more likely to attract customers to paying for the city-bike services?

With these questions in mind, I went about analyzig what made City-Bike data so successful in New York City.
